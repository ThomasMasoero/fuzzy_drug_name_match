# üíä Drug Name to ATC Code Matcher

This Python program is designed to clean and standardize drug names recorded in clinical case report forms (CRFs) by matching them to their corresponding **ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical)** codes. It supports both **generic** and **commercial** drug names and uses fuzzy string matching to handle typos and variations.

## üìÇ Input Files

Place the following Excel files in the **same folder as the script**:

1. **`ATC_DDD_Index ITA.xlsx`**  
   - Contains generic drug names and their corresponding ATC codes.  
   - Required columns:  
     - `Nome_L5`: Generic drug name  
     - `Codice ATC_L5`: ATC code  

2. **`commercial_name.xlsx`**  
   - Contains commercial (brand) names of drugs linked to ATC codes.  
   - Required columns:  
     - `MARCHIO`: Brand name of the drug  
     - `CODICE_ATC`: ATC code  
     - `PRINCIPIO_ATTIVO`: Active substance (optional for this script)  

3. **`terapie_altro.xlsx`**  
   - Contains clinician-entered drug names from the CRFs.  
   - Required column:  
     - `altro_farmaco`: Free-text drug names (may include typos, combinations, or separators like "+", "/", "vs", etc.)

## üß† Key Features

- **Flexible Separators:** Handles multiple drugs in a single field separated by `+`, `/`, `,`, `vs`, `e`, etc.
- **Fuzzy Matching:** Uses `rapidfuzz` to tolerate typos and non-standard spellings.
- **Generic + Commercial Matching:** Matches against both ATC generic names and brand names.
- **Case and Whitespace Normalization:** Cleans and standardizes all text inputs.
- **Portable:** Automatically detects its own directory to load and save files (no hard-coded paths).

## üì§ Output

- **`matched_results.xlsx`**  
  Excel file containing cleaned and matched drug entries.  
  Output columns:
  - `altro_farmaco`: Original entry (after splitting and cleaning)
  - `MatchedDrug`: Closest matched reference name
  - `ATCCode`: Corresponding ATC code
  - `Score`: Matching confidence score (0‚Äì100)

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

Install required packages with:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl rapidfuzz
```

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Place the script and all input files in the same folder.
2. Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python match_drug_names.py
```
